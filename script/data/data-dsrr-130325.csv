",https://learning.acm.org/techtalks/dataforgood,"Every field has data. We use data to discover new knowledge, to interpret the world, to make decisions, and even to predict the future. The recent convergence of big data, cloud computing, and novel machine learning algorithms and statistical methods is causing an explosive interest in data science and its applicability to all fields. This convergence has already enabled the automation of some tasks that better human performance. The novel capabilities we derive from data science will drive our cars, treat disease, and keep us safe. At the same time, such capabilities risk leading to biased, inappropriate, or unintended action.

The architecture of a standard neural network is inspired from the way the human brain functions. It is composed of connected nodes called neurons, which, through a series of real-valued activations help the network to learn complex functions. A neural network consists of several stages including input layer, hidden layers, and output layers.

What are our options? As we saw in the first part of this series, our first step should be to gather more data and perform feature engineering. Gathering more data and feature engineering usually has the greatest payoff in terms of time invested versus improved performance, but when we have exhausted all data sources, it’s time to move on to model hyperparameter tuning.

Implications of Knowledge Organization Systems for Health Information Exchange and Communication during the COVID-19 Pandemic,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2543925122000468?via%3Dihub,"This article aims to review the important roles of health knowledge organization systems (KOSs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Different types of knowledge organization systems, including term lists, synonym rings, thesauri, subject heading systems, taxonomies, classification schemes, and ontologies are widely recognized and applied in both modern and traditional information systems. Apart from their usage in the management of data, information, and knowledge, KOSs are seen as valuable components for large information architecture, content management, findability improvement, and many other applications. After introducing the challenges of information overload and semantic conflicts, the article reviews the efforts of major health KOSs, illustrates various health coding schemes, explains their usages and implementations, and reveals their implications for health information exchange and communication during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some general examples of the applications, services, and analysis powered by KOSs are presented at the end. As revealed in this article, they have become even more critical to aid the frontline endeavors to overcome the obstacles due to information overload and semantic conflicts that can occur during devastating historic and worldwide events like the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zeng Marcia Lei,Hong Yi,Clunis Julaine,He Shaoyi,Coladangelo L.P.",Learn & Teach,Article or Journal,"COVID,Quantum Computing",English

Using a recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH), Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc. A recursive function solves a particular problem by calling a copy of itself and solving smaller subproblems of the original problems. Many more recursive calls can be generated as and when required. It is essential to know that we should provide a certain case in order to terminate this recursion process.

"Regularization in Machine Learning
",https://towardsdatascience.com/regularization-in-machine-learning-76441ddcf99a,"One of the major aspects of training your machine learning model is avoiding overfitting. The model will have a low accuracy if it is overfitting. This happens because your model is trying too hard to capture the noise in your training dataset. By noise we mean the data points that don’t really represent the true properties of your data, but random chance. Learning such data points, makes your model more flexible, at the risk of overfitting.

Enabled by advances in technology such as the development of lower cost, lower power, smaller microprocessors and microcontrollers, cellular/wireless chips, and the enablement of more widespread machine-to-machine communications, IoT technologies are now more widely deployed. Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and question-answering systems (Ferrucci et al., 2010, Simmons, 1970) have enabled development of cognitive computing systems which can be applied to numerous use cases. There is an opportunity to leverage IoT and cognitive computing technologies together with data analytics (http://social-innovation.hitachi.com) to develop deeper insights from the vast amount of data being created by IoT to create value for people, cities, and industry. In this chapter, we explore the state of the art and future opportunities to apply IoT and cognitive computing together in IoT uses cases for smart cities and connected healthcare, to improve efficiencies, outcomes, and the human experience.","E.W.
