A Brief History of Data Ontology,https://www.dataversity.net/a-brief-history-of-data-ontology/,"It can be said that the history of data ontology starts with the development of ontology as a concept in Greece, back in the fourth century B.C.E. It was developed by Aristotle, the famous philosopher. Ontology is a branch of philosophy that is used to classify and explain “that which exists” or answer the question “What is real?” It relies on language as a tool for both thinking and communication, and involves questioning what things do exist, how they are related to one another (providing context), and how to classify these things according to their similarities and differences.",Keith D.

An analysis of ontologies and their success factors for application to business,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169023X1500110X,"Ontologies have been less successful than they could be in large-scale business applications due to a wide variety of interpretations. This leads to confusion, and consequently, people from various research communities use the term with different – sometimes incompatible – meanings. This research work analyzes and clarifies the term ontology and points out its difference from taxonomy. By way of two business case studies, both their potential in ontological engineering and the perceived requirements for ontologies are highlighted, and their misuse in research and business is discussed. In order to examine the case for applying ontologies in a specific domain or use case, the main benefits of using ontologies are defined and categorized as technical-centered or user-centered. Key factors that influence the use of ontologies in business applications are derived and discussed. Finally, the paper offers a recommendation for efficiently applying ontologies, including adequate representation languages and an ontological engineering process supported by reference ontologies. To answer the questions of when ontologies should be used, how they can be used efficiently, and when they should not be used, we propose guidelines for selecting an appropriate model, methodology, and tool set to meet customer requirements while making most efficient use of resources.

Our goal with the MDS-Onto Framework is to provide a unified and automated system for ontology development in the Materials and Data Sciences. This framework offers recommendations on where to publish ontologies online, how to best integrate them within the semantic web, and which formats to store and share ontologies. The framework aims to enhance the findability and interoperability of these ontologies. One critical component of the MDS-Onto Framework is the bilingual FAIRmaterials Python and R package, a practical and user-friendly tool for scientists to create and visualize ontologies effectively. We also present two domain ontologies created with our framework, X-ray diffraction and Photovoltaics(PV), to demonstrate the practical application and steps for implementing materials in ontology creation and merging. These cases highlight our framework's feasibility and efficiency.

Most of the knowledge of biology is categorical; statements such as “fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly” cannot be easily represented as mathematical or statistical relationships. These statements can, however, be formalized using ontologies: a form of model which represents the key concepts of a domain.

Ontologies for Data Science: On Its Application to Data Pipelines,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-14401-2_16,"Ontologies are usually applied to drive intelligent applications and also as a resource for integrating or extracting information, as in the case of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Further, ontologies as the Gene Ontology (GO) are used as an artifact for very specific research aims. However, the value of ontologies for data analysis tasks may also go beyond these uses and span supporting the reuse and composition of data acquisition, integration and fusion code. This requires that both data and code artifacts support meta-descriptions using shared conceptualizations. In this paper, we discuss the different concerns in semantically describing data pipelines as a key reusable artifact that could be retrieved, compared and reused with a degree of automation if semantically consistent descriptions are provided. Concretely, we propose attaching semantic descriptions for data and analytic transformations to current backend-independent distributed processing frameworks as Apache Beam, as these already abstract out the specificity of supporting execution engines.

Thus, while a system is generated, it should be designed in such a way that works in harmony with each of these data processing steps. Data analytics is one of the methods used to develop such a system. Data analytics applications are used in many different areas such as increasing market shares of a firm, customer behavior analysis, predicting the life of an electronic device, detection of the anomaly on a network, social network analysis, healthcare systems, chemical component interactions, and bank operations. These data analytics applications can obtain data from different sources, and these sources must interact with each other. It is not always easy to design this interactive architecture. These difficulties can be overcome by using ontologies. For data analytics, ontologies can be used for facilitating data collection, improving the quality of the data used, analyzing data, showing the obtained results, and ensuring the reusability of the designed system. In this study, we introduce an overview of data analytics and explain data analytics steps; in addition, we seek to answer the question of how to enrich and improve a data analytics system by using ontologies. We give different examples of how to use ontologies in different steps in the systems. Moreover, we emphasize the pros and cons of using ontologies in data analytics. We then discuss the future outlook for these ontologies for data analytics.

Ontology-based Access Control for FAIR Data,https://direct.mit.edu/dint/article/2/1-2/66/9993/Ontology-based-Access-Control-for-FAIR-Data,"This paper focuses on fine-grained, secure access to FAIR data, for which we propose ontology-based data access policies. These policies take into account both the FAIR aspects of the data relevant to access (such as provenance and licence), expressed as metadata, and additional metadata describing users. With this tripartite approach (data, associated metadata expressing FAIR information, and additional metadata about users), secure and controlled access to object data can be obtained. This yields a security dimension to the “A” (accessible) in FAIR, which is clearly needed in domains like security and intelligence. These domains need data to be shared under tight controls, with widely varying individual access rights. In this paper, we propose an approach called Ontology-Based Access Control (OBAC), which utilizes concepts and relations from a data set's domain ontology. We argue that ontology-based access policies contribute to data reusability and can be reconciled with privacy-aware data access policies. We illustrate our OBAC approach through a proof-of-concept and propose that OBAC to be adopted as a best practice for access management of FAIR data.","Christopher Brewster,Barry Nouwt,Stephan Raajimakers,Jack Verhoosel",Research & Practice,Article or Journal,Ontology,English
Ontology-based Data Management in Healthcare,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380513046_Ontology-based_Data_Management_in_Healthcare,"Nowadays, the study of Big Data has become crucial to guarantee technical advancements in the large majority of the modern computer systems. Within the Healthcare context, this is even a more valid challenge, having the requirement to deploy systems capable of tacking huges amounts of periodically-generated data and with clear standards for assessing data quality, in order to carry on any kind of study. Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to present the results of the application of an Ontology-based data management (OBDM) methodology, developed in the context of the Italian Registry of implantable prostheses (RIPI) project, at National Institute of Health. In particular, its application from scratch to the Italian Arthroplasty Registry (RIAP), one of the registries included in RIPI, is presented. Moreover, the same methodology has been also followed by the Sapienza information-based Technology InnovaTion Center for Health (STITCH) research group to deal with another relevant healthcare domain: the management of the Italian Association of Diabetologists (AMD) data. Healthcare domains are usually suitable to be modeled through ontologies, since they follow rules which are well-known by the involved stakeholders. However, clinical data are often provided by several local sources, thus they have to be properly integrated into a central repository in order to be clean and standardized. For this reason, managing this process requires a tight collaboration between computer scientists and healthcare stakeholders, with the purpose of creating systems capable of leveraging the inestimable value of healthcare data through the most suitable approaches of the field. RIAP data layer has been improved up to the point of allowing the project managers to publish a cumulative report on fifteen years of the activity of the registry; AMD dataset was centralized, cleansed and standardized so that several research groups could start to investigate on data, using a data-driven approach to unlock the potential of the involved medical information. From this two real-world experiences, it is possible to conclude that ontologies can enhance healthcare capabilities not only to express the expertise of the clinicians, but also to ease data analytics processes and research.",Riccardo Valentini,Research & Practice,Article or Journal,"Ontology,Data Structures",English

"Orchestrating Knowledge Networks: Alter-Oriented Brokering
",https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01492063221086247,"In knowledge networks, such as best-practice networks, industry forums, and professional communities, members of different organizations exchange knowledge for mutual and individual benefit. When properly managed, knowledge networks enable time- and resource-constrained individuals to engage across organizational and industry boundaries. Such networks often involve deliberate orchestration by a hub actor (individual, team, or organization), often referred to as the orchestrator. Orchestration in a network of individuals is essentially a form of brokering behavior. While most previous studies of orchestration and brokerage have adopted a broker-centric perspective, the present study advances an alter-oriented account of how brokering behavior influences relationships to create knowledge-related benefits for individual network members. Drawing on interviews with 51 members of a Belgian knowledge network focusing on best practices in research and development, this study explores the orchestrator's brokering behavior and ensuing benefits for network members. Based on these findings, the study describes an integrative model of alter-oriented brokering processes that modify, intermediate, and maintain relationships among alters in orchestrated knowledge networks.

"The Data Use Ontology to streamline responsible access to human biomedical datasets
",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666979X21000355,"Human biomedical datasets that are critical for research and clinical studies to benefit human health also often contain sensitive or potentially identifying information of individual participants. Thus, care must be taken when they are processed and made available to comply with ethical and regulatory frameworks and informed consent data conditions. To enable and streamline data access for these biomedical datasets, the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Data Use and Researcher Identities (DURI) work stream developed and approved the Data Use Ontology (DUO) standard. DUO is a hierarchical vocabulary of human and machine-readable data use terms that consistently and unambiguously represents a dataset’s allowable data uses. DUO has been implemented by major international stakeholders such as the Broad and Sanger Institutes and is currently used in annotation of over 200,000 datasets worldwide. Using DUO in data management and access facilitates researchers’ discovery and access of relevant datasets. DUO annotations increase the FAIRness of datasets and support data linkages using common data use profiles when integrating the data for secondary analyses. DUO is implemented in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and, to increase community awareness and engagement, hosted in an open, centralized GitHub repository. DUO, together with the GA4GH Passport standard, offers a new, efficient, and streamlined data authorization and access framework that has enabled increased sharing of biomedical datasets worldwide.","Jonathan Lawson,Moran N.

The Ontology of Biological Attributes (OBA) - Computational Traits for the Life Sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9900877/,"The Ontology of Biological Attributes (OBA) is a formalised, species-independent collection of interoperable phenotypic trait categories that is intended to fulfil a data integration role. OBA is a standardised representational framework for observable attributes that are characteristics of biological entities, organisms, or parts of organisms. OBA has a modular design which provides several benefits for users and data integrators, including an automated and meaningful classification of trait terms computed on the basis of logical inferences drawn from domain-specific ontologies for cells, anatomical and other relevant entities. The logical axioms in OBA also provide a previously missing bridge that can computationally link Mendelian phenotypes with GWAS and quantitative traits. The term components in OBA provide semantic links and enable knowledge and data integration across specialised research community boundaries, thereby breaking silos.

"Toward Data Driven Ontologies for Mental Function
",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwOHERNd3aQ,"Psychological science has long been focused on the discovery of novel behavioral phenomena and the mechanistic explanation of those phenomena, which has led to a lack of cumulative conceptual progress. Dr. Poldrack will argue that the development of ontologies is essential for progress, but that these need to be tied directly to empirical data. He will provide an example from the domain of self-regulation, where we have used data-driven ontology development to describe the psychological structure of this domain and characterize its predictive validity with respect to real-world outcomes.

For each, there are allies who stand behind research evidence and consistency of observation. Meantime, those existing theories dominate the field until the background is changed or new concrete evidence proves their insufficiencies. Connectivists claim that the background or the general climate has recently changed: a new generation of researchers, connectivists propose a new way of conceiving knowledge.","Alaa A.

",https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2018/07/20/why-ontology-will-be-a-big-word-in-your-companys-future/,"While there are a number of different ways you can describe this language, one of the more useful is called an ontology, which quite literally means the study of the names of things. The idea behind ontologies is relatively simple, though it has some profound implications. In effect, imagine all of the resources that your company sells, buys or uses to process stuff as classes of resources. In your car dealerships, automobiles, dealerships, sales-people, contracts and so forth would be resources, while in a publishing company, books, authors, editors, publishers, printing machines, printers and so forth are also considered resources.","Kurt Cagle,Forbes",Learn & Teach,Article or Journal,Ontology,English
